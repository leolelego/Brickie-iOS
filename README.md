> Brickie is searching minifigs to help improve the app. I'm currently not really available and I can be able to validate and checks PR but I have less time to improve the app itself. So if you love SwiftUI and bricks, feel **free to add your own touch to the app!**


# Brickie: The BrickSet Companion for iOS

Brickie is an iOS application powered by the BrickSet API which permits to manage your Lego of sets and minifigures collection. 

## Open Source, Technologies and Privacy

As this project is a side project I decided to use the last new tech made by Apple to do it. So it's full of SwiftUI, Combine and SDKs are powered by Swift Package Manager. 

This project is Open source and I will love you to give me help to imporve this app. If you knows some Swift and iOS things, feel free to fork and make any PR! I will review them with pleasure. 
Please don't copy this app, I do open-source to offert something create to LEGO fans like me, the app is free, so help to make it awesome! 

You don't know sh*t about iOS, no worries, tell me any ideas you have thought a **Github Issue** and I will do my best if it's revelant!

### Privacy Policy

**We do not collect any of your data**. The only data collected is collected from within the app itself and only stored locally like your owned and wanted sets/figs. 
We don't dislay any ads or send anything to any server. So we don't track you using an advertising identifier or anything.
